Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: What software did you use to make these? How can I tweak them?

A: I use MagicaVoxel for creating the initial files / rendering. Unity3D for prefabs.

Q: Are these characters rigged?

A: Nope. I don't really understand how to fit that into my process. I recommend making them waddle or sticking a popsicle stick up their butt and dragging them around.

Q: Yo, you're a dick and just took Mike's hard work!

A: No. Read the Licensing and I'm building more, my goal is to have both inside and outside models so you can make a world. Think of this as a game jam goldmine.

Q: Who made what? It seems like some of the artwork does not match.

A: Look at his repo and figure it out, aint no body got time for that.

Q: Do you take request?

A: Yeah, but don't be pushy NYPA.
