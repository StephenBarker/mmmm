Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: What software did you use to make these? How can I tweak them?

A: I use MagicaVoxel for creating the initial files / rendering, and VoxelShop for exporting 
optimized collada polys.

Q: Are these characters rigged?

A: Nope. I don't really understand how to fit that into my process. I recommend making them waddle or sticking a popsicle stick up their butt and dragging them around.
